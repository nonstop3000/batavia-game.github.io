They weren’t animal bones at all. They were human. And they weren’t buried, either — they were discarded. The image shifts. Maybe it wasn’t just order being enforced here. Maybe it was violence disguised as authority. Maybe those seals and relics were just masks — covers for something far darker. You missed it. But now you see. And if you want to understand what really happened… you’ll have to start again.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Merchant_Ship.recoveredReligio.0.7.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^Back to mission breifing ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Merchant_Ship.recoveredReligio.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.7.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Mission_Briefing"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"thisIsWhatEveryd":[["#","^IMAGE: https://media.tenor.com/8d3dX18gSj8AAAAM/scraping-ancient-china-from-above.gif","/#","^This is what everyday archaeologists have to do most days while out in the field. They find artefacts and evidence of events occurring and have to piece it all together to find out what happened. It's a hard job, isn't it? And they don't get a list of options to choose from. What you’ve just done — examining artefacts, building interpretations, questioning assumptions, and following evidence to sometimes uncomfortable conclusions — is exactly what archaeologists do. In the real world, archaeologists rarely uncover complete stories. They work with fragments: scattered bones, broken tools, buried structures, and incomplete records. From these traces, they ask questions like:","\n",["^Who lived here?","\n",["^What happened?","\n",["^Why was this item placed here, in this way?","\n",["^Is there more than one possible story?","\n","#","^IMAGE: https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/archaeologist-working-archaeology-site_798657-2731.jpg","/#","^And just like you’ve seen, the first explanation isn’t always the right one. Archaeologists constantly revisit earlier conclusions as new artefacts are uncovered, or old evidence is seen in a new light. What once looked like a peaceful village might turn out to be a conflict zone. A simple grave might hint at a dark death. A collapsed shelter could mark survival — or rebellion. In this way, archaeology is not about digging things up — it’s about putting stories together. It’s slow, uncertain, and full of interpretation. But it’s also powerful. Because in piecing together the lives of the past, archaeologists help us understand how humans respond to disaster, power, conflict, and survival — and what those stories still mean today.","\n","end",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-3"}],{"#f":5,"#n":"g-2"}],{"#f":5,"#n":"g-1"}],{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}};
